# File I/O
Project done during **Software Engineering** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about function pointers in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc` using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* C files are written in `Betty` coding style
* Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

## Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:
| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-read_textfile.c` | Reads a text file and prints it to the `POSIX` standard output |
| `1-create_file.c` | Creates a file |
| `2-append_text_to_file.c` | Appends text at the end of a file |
| `3-cp.c` | Copies the content of a file to another file |
| `100-elf_header.c` | Displays the information contained in the `ELF` header at the start of an `ELF` file |
