# Low-level programming & Algorithm

Module of **Low-level programming** carried out during **Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash
* C files are compiled using `gcc` using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* C files are written in `Betty` coding style
* Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
