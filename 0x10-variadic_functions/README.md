#Variadic functions
Project done during **Software Engineering** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about function pointers in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc` using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* C files are written in `Betty` coding style
* Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:
| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-sum_them_all.c` | Returns the sum of all its parameters |
| `1-print_numbers.c` | Prints numbers |
| `2-print_strings.c` | Prints strings |
| `3-print_all.c` | Prints anything |
