# Function pointers
Project done during **Software Engineering** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about function pointers in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc` using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* C files are written in `Betty` coding style
* Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-print_name.c` | Prints a name |
| `1-array_iterator.c` | Executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array |
| `2-int_index.c` | Searches for an integer |
| `3-calc.h` | Header file that contains all function prototypes and data structures |
| `3-op_functions.c` | File that contains functions that calculates arithmetic operations |
| `3-get_op_func.c` | Function pointer that returns the pointer of the arithmetic functions |
| `3-main.c` | Entry point |
| `100-main_opcodes.c` | Prints the opcodes of its own main function |
| `function_pointers.h`| Header file |
