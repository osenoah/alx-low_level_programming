# Malloc, free
Project done during **Software Engineering** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about automatic and dynamic allocation in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc` using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* C files are written in `Betty` coding style
* Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-create_array.c` | Creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char |
| `1-strdup.c` | Returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter |
| `2-str_concat.c` | Concatenates two strings |
| `3-alloc_grid.c` | Returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers |
| `4-free_grid.c` | Frees a 2 dimensional grid previously allocated in the heap memory |
| `100-argstostr.c` | Concatenates all the arguments of a program |
| `101-strtow.c` | Splits a string into words |
