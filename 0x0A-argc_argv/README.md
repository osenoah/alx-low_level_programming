# Argc, argv
Project done during **Software Engineering** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about how to use arguments passed to a program in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc` using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* C files are written in `Betty` coding style
* Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-whatsmyname.c` | Prints its name |
| `1-args.c` | Prints the number of arguments passed into it |
| `2-args.c` | Prints all arguments it receives |
| `3-mul.c` | Multiplies two numbers |
| `4-add.c` | Adds positive numbers |
| `100-change.c` | Prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money |
