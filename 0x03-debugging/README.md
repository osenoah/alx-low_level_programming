# Debugging

Project done during ** Software Engineering ** at **ALX**. It aims to learn how to debug in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc compiler`
* C files are written usin `Betty` coding style
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-main.c` | Test that function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0` |
