# Pointers, arrays and strings

Project done during **Software Engineering** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc ` using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* C files are written in `Betty` coding style
* Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-reset_to_98.c` | Takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to `98` |
| `1-swap.c` | Swaps the values of two integers |
| `2-strlen.c` | Returns the length of a string |
| `3-puts.c` | Prints a string to `stdout` |
| `4-print_rev.c` | Prints a string, in reverse |
| `5-rev_string.c` | Reverses a string |
| `6-puts2.c` | Prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character |
| `7-puts_half.c` | Prints half of a string |
| `8-print_array.c` | Prints `n` elements of an array of integers |
| `9-strcpy.c` | Copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte, to the buffer pointed to by `dest` |
| `100-atoi.c` | Converts a string to an integer |
| `101-keygen.c` | Generates random valid passwords for the program `101-crackme` |
