# C - Variables, if, else and while

Project done during **Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about arithmetic operators, relational operators, boolean operators, comments, declaring variables and loops in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-positive_or_negative.c` | Prints `is positive`, `is zero` or `is negative` when a randomly generated number is any of these cases |
| `1-last_digit.c` | Prints the last digit of a randomly generated number |
| `2-print_alphabet.c` | Prints the alphabet in lowercase |
| `3-print_alphabets.c` | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase |
| `4-print_alphabet.c` | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, except `q` and `e` letters |
| `5-print_numbers.c` | Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0` |
| `6-print_numberz.c` | Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, without using `char` variables |
| `7-print_tebahpla.c` | Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse |
| `8-print_base16.c` | Prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase |
| `9-print_comb.c` | Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers |
| `100-print_comb3.c` | Prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by `,` |
| `101-print_comb4.c` | Prints all possible different combinations of three digits, separated by `,` |
| `102-print_comb5.c` | Prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers |
