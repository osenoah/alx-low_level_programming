# Structures, typedef
Project done during **Software Engineering** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about structures and `typedef` in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc` using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* C files are written in `Betty` coding style
* Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04` LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `dog.h` | Header file that contains a `struct dog` |
| `1-init_dog.c` | Initialize a variable of type `struct dog` |
| `2-print_dog.c` | Prints a `struct dog` |
| `3-islower.c` | Checks for lowercase character |
| `4-new_dog.c` | Creates a new dog |
| `5-free_dog.c` | Frees a dog |
