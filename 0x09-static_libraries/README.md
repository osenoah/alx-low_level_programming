# Static libraries

Project done during **Software Engineering** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about static libraries in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in `Bash`
* C files are compiled using `gcc` using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* C files are written in `Betty` coding style
* Tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `libmy.a` | Static library that contains a lot of functions |
| `create_static_lib.sh` | Script that creates a static library called `liball.a` from all the `.c` files that are in the current directory |
| `main.h` | Header file that contains all the prototypes of the used functions |
