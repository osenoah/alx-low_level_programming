# Even more pointers, arrays and strings

Project done during **Software Engineering** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc` using options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* C files are written in `Betty` coding style
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-memset.c` | Fills memory with a constant byte |
| `1-memcpy.c` | Copies memory area |
| `2-strchr.c` | Locates a character in a string |
| `3-strspn.c` | Gets the length of a prefix substring |
| `4-strpbrk.c` | Searches a string for any of a set of bytes |
| `5-strstr.c` | Locates a substring |
| `7-print_chessboard.c` | Prints the chessboard |
| `8-print_diagsums.c` | Prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers |
| `100-set_string.c` | Sets the value of a pointer to a char |
| `101-crackme_password.c` | Contains the password for the `crackme2` executable |
